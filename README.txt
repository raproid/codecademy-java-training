Free training course on Java I covered on CodeAcademy.

Numbers, hyphens and lesson names can be excluded from the filenames and are introduced for concistency and clearification purposes while browsing.

I tried to write every class from scratch never referring to the pre-set examples if possible. Success rate ~95%.
